# Lumo AI

Lumo AI is an on-chain, AI-powered DeFAI investment platform that automates long-term wealth building across multiple DeFi protocols, including lending, liquidity, and yield strategies. It converts user goals into optimized allocations and executes them on-chain through smart contracts.

Using Coinbase's Spend Permissions, Lumo enables secure, controlled automation—letting users grant limited, revocable spending permissions for both SIP investments (USDC) and AI agent payments (ETH).

## 🧠 What Problem Does Lumo AI Solve?

Most DeFi platforms today require:

* Manual intervention for recurring investments
* Complex multi-step transactions
* Constant monitoring of allocations
* Trust in custodial solutions

Lumo AI removes these limitations by enabling:

* Automated Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) using USDC
* AI-powered strategy optimization with ETH agent payments
* On-chain, verifiable transactions via spend permissions
* Fully autonomous execution with user-defined limits

## ⚡ How Coinbase Spend Permissions Power Lumo AI

**Spend Permissions** enable controlled automation without giving up custody.

In Lumo AI:

* Users grant **two separate spend permissions**:
  * **SIP Permission (USDC)**: For automated monthly investments
  * **Agent Permission (ETH)**: For AI strategy optimization fees
* Every transaction is **amount-limited and time-bound**
* Permissions are **revocable at any time**

There are:

* ❌ No unlimited approvals
* ❌ No custodial risk
* ❌ No trusted intermediaries

Just **secure, autonomous DeFi investing**.

## 🔁 How Lumo AI Works

1. User connects a Coinbase CDP Smart Wallet
2. User interacts with the AI chat interface to configure their investment plan
3. AI generates an optimized strategy across Aave, Compound, and Uniswap
4. User grants spend permissions:
   * **SIP Permission**: USDC allowance for monthly investments
   * **Agent Permission**: ETH allowance for AI optimization fees
5. Lumo's server executes SIPs automatically using cron jobs
6. (Optional) Monthly rebalancing via AI agent

This ensures:

* Predictable, automated investments
* Transparent fee structure
* User maintains full control

## 💸 DeFAI in Action

Lumo AI combines:

* **DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI)** → for AI-generated, optimized investment strategies
* **Coinbase Spend Permissions** → for secure, controlled automation

User goals (car, house, education) are translated into allocations across multiple DeFi platforms.

Users can choose:

* ✅ **Fixed strategy execution**
  * Same allocation reused every SIP
  * No additional AI spend after setup
* ✅ **Monthly AI rebalancing**
  * AI agents re-evaluate strategies each SIP cycle
  * ETH agent payments occur monthly

All execution happens automatically after one-time approval.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

* **UI**: Goal-based AI chat + dashboard
* **Smart Wallets**: Coinbase CDP for spend permissions
* **Next.js Backend**: Orchestrates SIPs and cron-based execution
* **Smart Contracts**: Execute DeFi strategies on Base Sepolia
* **Spend Permissions**: Controlled automation layer

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Lumo AI demonstrates:

* DeFAI as a practical investment strategy
* Spend permissions enabling trustless automation
* AI-powered allocation without custody risk
* Cron-based execution for hands-free investing

## 🔮 Future Scope

### x402 Protocol Integration

In future versions, Lumo AI may integrate the **x402 protocol** for:

* Pay-per-use AI micropayments
* Agent-to-agent payment coordination
* Real-time, on-chain verification of AI service payments

This would enable a fully decentralized AI marketplace where agents autonomously pay each other for specialized services.

# Lumo AI

Lumo AI is an on-chain, pay-per-use AI investment platform that automates long-term wealth building across multiple DeFi protocols, including lending, liquidity, and yield strategies. It converts user goals into optimized allocations and executes them on-chain through smart contracts.

Instead of subscriptions or API keys, Lumo AI uses x402 to enable direct, verifiable micropayments between AI agents—ensuring every strategy update and decision is paid for in real time, transparently and on-chain.

## 🧠 What Problem Does Lumo AI Solve?

Most AI services today rely on:

* Monthly subscriptions
* API keys
* Centralized payment infrastructure

This makes it impossible for **AI agents to independently purchase services from other AI agents**.

Lumo AI removes these limitations by enabling:

* Pay-per-query AI access
* On-chain, verifiable micropayments
* Fully autonomous agent-to-agent interactions

## ⚡ Why x402 Is the Core of Lumo AI

**x402** enables AI agents to pay each other directly using crypto micropayments.

In Lumo AI:

* Every AI request is a **paid request**
* Every AI response is **payment-gated**
* Every transaction is **verifiable on-chain**

There are:

* ❌ No API keys
* ❌ No subscriptions
* ❌ No trusted intermediaries

Just **value-for-value intelligence exchange**.

## 🔁 How x402 Works in Lumo AI

1. A user interacts with Lumo AI to request an investment strategy.
2. Lumo’s requesting agent initiates an **x402 payment** (e.g. `0.001 USDC`).
3. The payment is routed through an **x402 facilitator**.
4. The Expert AI agent:

   * Verifies the payment
   * Only responds **after confirmation**
5. The strategy is returned and executed on-chain.

This ensures:

* No free queries
* No unpaid AI responses
* Fully trustless coordination between agents

## 💸 DeFAI + x402 in Action

Lumo AI combines:

* **x402** → for real-time agent-to-agent micropayments
* **DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI)** → for executing AI-generated investment strategies

User goals (car, house, education) are translated into allocations across multiple DeFi platforms.

Users can choose:

* ✅ **Monthly AI rebalancing**

  * AI agents re-evaluate strategies every SIP cycle
  * x402 payments occur monthly
* ❌ **Fixed strategy execution**

  * Same allocation reused every SIP
  * No additional AI spend after setup

All execution happens automatically after one-time approval.

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

* **UI**: Goal-based AI chat + dashboard
* **Smart Wallets**: Automate payments and execution
* **Next.js Backend**: Orchestrates agents and x402 flows
* **Smart Contracts**: Execute DeFi strategies
* **x402**: Payment rail between AI agents

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Lumo AI is not just an investment app.

It demonstrates:

* Pay-per-use AI as a protocol
* Intelligence as an on-chain commodity
* AI agents forming real economic relationships
* x402 as the missing payment layer for autonomous systems
